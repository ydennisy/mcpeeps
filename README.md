## Idea

The core idea was to prototype an AI-powered boardroom, where [A2A](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/) compatible agents collaborate across a network to create a shared artifact. For the hack, we chose to have them build a game, though the game itself wasnâ€™t the primary goal. Our real focus was on exploring how agents collaborate when deployed as independent services versus the more common approach of sub-agents operating within a local graph or swarm.
